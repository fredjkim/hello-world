This is my submission for **Markdown** in which I will be testing some of Github's _annotating features_
I'm _not_ sure where this submission is supposed to be posted but I assume that     
>make a submission
refers to Github files. The instruction is open ended. 


1. Commit the time. - This **shouldn't** be an issue. I'm rather disciplined with my time and am very excited to push and learn. 
1. Avoid lulls. - **Also** not an issue. I am uncomfortable with _not_ learning. 
1. Make good use of your mentor! - Ah, this should require some more thought on my end. I want to leverage this with valuable questions on my end. 
1. Ride the roller coaster. - Mm, perhaps _this_ will be the struggle. I will need to be persistant. 
1. Learn to forage. - I am fairly resourceful and shouldn't have a problem with this.
